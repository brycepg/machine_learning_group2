\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is meant to be used as a choice for the policy class Root\-Point\-Policy of the \doxyref{Cover\-Tree}{p.}{classmlpack_1_1tree_1_1CoverTree} class. 

This policy determines which point is used for the root node of the cover tree. This particular implementation simply chooses the first point in the dataset as the root. A more complex implementation might choose, for instance, the point with least maximum distance to other points (the closest to the \char`\"{}middle\char`\"{}).
