Defines the L\-S\-H\-Search class, which performs an approximate nearest neighbor search for a queries in a query set over a given dataset using Locality-\/sensitive hashing with 2-\/stable distributions.

The details of this method can be found in the following paper\-:

\{datar2004locality, title=\{Locality-\/sensitive hashing scheme based on p-\/stable distributions\}, author=\{Datar, M. and Immorlica, N. and Indyk, P. and Mirrokni, V.\-S.\}, booktitle= \{Proceedings of the 12th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry\}, pages=\{253--262\}, year=\{2004\}, organization=\{A\-C\-M\} \}
