An implementation of Maximum Variance Unfolding. This file defines an M\-V\-U class as well as a class representing the objective function (a semidefinite program) which M\-V\-U seeks to minimize. Minimization is performed by the Augmented Lagrangian optimizer (which in turn uses the L-\/\-B\-F\-G\-S optimizer).

Note\-: this implementation of M\-V\-U does not work. See \#189.
