class {\bf mlpack\-::lcc\-::\-Local\-Coordinate\-Coding$<$ Dictionary\-Initializer $>$}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em An implementation of Local Coordinate Coding (L\-C\-C) that codes data which approximately lives on a manifold using a variation of l1-\/norm regularized sparse coding; in L\-C\-C, the penalty on the absolute value of each point's coefficient for each atom is weighted by the squared distance of that point to that atom. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
