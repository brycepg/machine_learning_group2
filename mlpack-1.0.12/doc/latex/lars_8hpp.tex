Definition of the L\-A\-R\-S class, which performs Least Angle Regression and the L\-A\-S\-S\-O.

Only minor modifications of L\-A\-R\-S are necessary to handle the constrained version of the problem\-:

\[ \min_{\beta} 0.5 || X \beta - y ||_2^2 + 0.5 \lambda_2 || \beta ||_2^2 \] subject to $ ||\beta||_1 <= \tau $

Although this option currently is not implemented, it will be implemented very soon.
