Class \doxyref{mlpack\-:\-:C\-L\-I}{p.}{classmlpack_1_1CLI} ]The {\bfseries C\-O\-U\-N\-T\-E\-R} variable is used in most cases to guarantee a unique global identifier for options declared using the P\-A\-R\-A\-M\-\_\-$\ast$() macros. However, not all compilers have this support--most notably, gcc $<$ 4.\-3. In that case, the {\bfseries L\-I\-N\-E} macro is used as an attempt to get a unique global identifier, but collisions are still possible, and they produce bizarre error messages.
