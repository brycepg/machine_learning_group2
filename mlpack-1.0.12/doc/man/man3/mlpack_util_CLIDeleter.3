.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Extremely simple class whose only job is to delete the existing \fBCLI\fP object at the end of execution\&. 

This is meant to allow the user to avoid typing '\fBCLI::Destroy()\fP' at the end of their program\&. The file also defines a static \fBCLIDeleter\fP class, which will be initialized at the beginning of the program and deleted at the end\&. The destructor destroys the \fBCLI\fP singleton\&.
