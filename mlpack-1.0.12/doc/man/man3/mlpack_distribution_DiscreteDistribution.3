.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A discrete distribution where the only observations are discrete observations\&. 

This is useful (for example) with discrete Hidden Markov Models, where observations are non-negative integers representing specific emissions\&.
.PP
No bounds checking is performed for observations, so if an invalid observation is passed (i\&.e\&. observation > numObservations), a crash will probably occur\&.
.PP
This distribution only supports one-dimensional observations, so when passing an arma::vec as an observation, it should only have one dimension (vec\&.n_rows == 1)\&. Any additional dimensions will simply be ignored\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This class, like every other class in MLPACK, uses arma::vec to represent observations\&. While a discrete distribution only has positive integers (size_t) as observations, these can be converted to doubles (which is what arma::vec holds)\&. This distribution internally converts those doubles back into size_t before comparisons\&.
