.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This initialization rule initializes matrix W and H to root of average of V with uniform noise\&. 

Uniform noise is generated by Armadillo's 'randu' function\&. To have a better effect lower bound of the matrix is subtracted from average before dividing it by the factorization rank\&. This computed value is added with the random noise\&.
