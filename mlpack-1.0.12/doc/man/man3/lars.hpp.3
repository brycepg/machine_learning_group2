Definition of the LARS class, which performs Least Angle Regression and the LASSO\&.
.PP
Only minor modifications of LARS are necessary to handle the constrained version of the problem:
.PP
\[ \min_{\beta} 0.5 || X \beta - y ||_2^2 + 0.5 \lambda_2 || \beta ||_2^2 \] subject to $ ||\beta||_1 <= \tau $
.PP
Although this option currently is not implemented, it will be implemented very soon\&.
